The directory P-CONF_1.6M contains 8000 directories: one for each tripeptide sequence.
The tripeptide subdirectories in P-CONF_1.6M contain PDB files representing conformers that are local energy minima.
The energies of these conformers are given in the header information of the PDB file.
The meanings of these different energies are given in the paper. 

extract_info_4.py uses MDAnalysis to extract phi and psi dihedral angles from the PDB files.
It also reads the energies from the headers of the PDB files and writes them, along with the phi and psi angles, to the extracted_info directory

they_said_to_ignore_these.txt contains a list of conformers that should have been excluded from the database (https://osf.io/7nwu4/wiki/home/)

structures_without_energies.txt contains a list of conformers that were not flagged by the authors as ones to ignore but lack energy information in the PDB header.

make_cmaps.py reads the information in the extracted_info directory (created by extract_info_4.py), looping over each sequence.
It assigns a gaussian well in phi-psi space to each memory conformer for each sequence and sums the gaussian wells to construct an energy surface.
It then writes this tabulated potential in a form that is compatible with the rama_AM function in the OpenAWSEM code, which uses the OpenMM CMAPTorsionForce
This script also plots the potential in phi/psi space.

The cmaps directory has a plots subdirectory and a data subdirectory, holding the energy surface plots and numerical data described above.
