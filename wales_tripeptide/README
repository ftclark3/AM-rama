This directory should contain:
    *   jp2c04647_si_002.zip (download from https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04647?goto=supporting-info)
    *   TripeptideConformations directory (unzip jp2c04647_si_002.zip) 
    *   analysis directory:
    -       extract_data.py

The TripeptideConformations directory contains the following files:
    *    a README
    *    csv files for all tripeptide sequences,
            except those containing GLY or ALA as the middle residue,
            but including the histidine ionization states/tautomers,
            HID (proton at delta position), HIE (proton at epsilon position), 
            and HIP (doubly protonated ==> positively charged)
    *    csv files have names like ALA_VAL_ALA_new.csv
Each row in each CSV represents a different conformer (each being a local minimum on the free energy landscape). 
The csv files have a variable number of rows.
Rows (conformers) are sorted in order of increasing free energy.
Free energy is reported in the first column of each row.
The free energy of the lowest-free energy conformer is set to 0.
I think the free energy is in units of kcal/mol, based on Fig. 5 from the paper.
Other columns in the csv files specify the dihedral angles. 
The number of columns varies between files because different sequences have different numbers of dihedral angles. 
The dihedral angles are ordered by residue (so the dihedral angles of the N-terminal residue come first, and so on). 
Within a given residue, dihedral angles are ordered like this: phi, psi, chi1-5 (if present).  
So, a row might look like this:
FREE_ENERGY, PHI(RES 1), PSI(RES 1), CHI1(RES 1), PHI(RES 2), PSI(RES 2), CHI1(RES 2), CHI2(RES 2), PHI(RES 3), PSI(RES 3)

The script analysis/extract_data.py loops over the CSV files in TripeptideConformations and reformats the relevant data from each file into a numpy array, saved to the directory analysis/stats_by_seq. 
The numpy arrays saved in stats_by_seq have 3 rows and a number of columns equal to the number of conformers sampled for that sequence.
The first row is the phi angle of the middle residue, the second the psi angle of the middle residue, and the third the free energy of the conformer.
This script also writes analysis/HID_scatterplot.png and analysis/HIE_scatterplot.png so that the sampled confomers and energies of the two histidine tautomers may be compared.
As expected, the plots are similar, reassuring us that we can pick either HID or HIE for further analysis.
