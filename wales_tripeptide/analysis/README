The TripeptideConformations directory contains the following files:
a README
csv files for all tripeptide sequences:
    except those containing GLY or ALA as the middle residue
    but including HIE, HID, and HIP
csv files have names like ALA_VAL_ALA_new.csv

The csv files have a variable number of rows. Each row represents a different conformer (specifically, a local minimum)
that was sampled. The first column in each row is the free energy relative to the lowest free energy conformer that was sampled
for the given sequence. Conformers are sorted in order of increasing free energy. I think the free energy is in units of kcal/mol,
because they use those units in Fig. 5 of the paper. Other columns in the row specify the dihedral angles. The dihedral angles
of each residue are grouped together. The number of columns varies across files because different sequences have different numbers
of dihedral angles. Within a given residue, dihedral angles are ordered like this: phi, psi, chi1-5 (if present).  


Since HIP is charged and openawsem doesn't put charges on histidine, I'm going to ignore the HIP files.
I'll compare HID results to HIE results. I don't expect them to be dramatically different. see script extract_data.py

The numpy arrays saved in stats_by_seq have 3 rows and a number of columns equal to the number of conformers sampled for that sequence. The first row is the phi angle, the second the psi angle, and the third the energy.
